pimote
=====

*pimote* is an android remote control for [raspmbc](http://www.raspbmc.com/).  It uses the json-rpc control interface to [xbmc](http://xbmc.org/) and in all likelihood will work perfectly well with any xbmc installation.  However, it was written specifically to control raspbmc on the raspberry pi and was only tested on such.
